## What is NooBaa

NooBaa can collapse multiple storage silos into a single, scalable storage fabric, by its ability to virtualize any local storage, whether shared or dedicated, physical or virtual and include both private and public cloud storage, using the same S3 API and management tools. NooBaa also gives you full control over data placement, letting you place data based on security, strategy and cost considerations, in the granularity of an application.
