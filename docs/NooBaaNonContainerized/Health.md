## Introduction
The Health CLI tool is a powerful command-line interface designed to efficiently analyze the NooBaa service, endpoints, accounts and buckets health.

## Installation
Health CLI installed automatically during the NooBaa RPM installation.
For more details about NooBaa RPM installation, see - [Getting Started](./GettingStarted.md).


## General Information 
* NooBaa Health CLI will analyze the following aspects - 
  - `NooBaa service health`
    - Verifying that the NooBaa service is active and has a valid PID (not equal to 0).
  - `NooBaa endpoints health`
    - Ensuring that the NooBaa endpoint is running.
  - `NooBaa accounts Health`
    - Iterating accounts under the config directory.
    - Confirming the existence of the account's configuration file and its validity as a JSON file.
    - Verifying that the account's `new_buckets_path` is defined and `allow_bucket_creation` is set to true.
    - Ensuring that the account has read and write access to its new_buckets_path.
  - `NooBaa buckets health` 
    - Iterating buckets under the config directory.
    - Confirming the existence of the bucket's configuration file and its validity as a JSON file.
    - Verifying that the underlying storage path of a bucket exists.
  - `Config directory health`
    - checks if config system and directory data exists
    - returns the config directory status 
  - `Config directory upgrade health`
    - checks if config system and directory data exists
    - checks if there is ongoing upgrade
    - returns error if there is no ongoing upgrade, but the config directory phase is locked
    - returns message if there is no ongoing upgrade and the config directory is unlocked
  - `Bucket event notifications connections health`
    - Sends out a test notification for each connection.

* Health CLI requires root permissions.

* Add `2>/dev/null` to the NooBaa CLI commands for omitting stderr logs printed by NooBaa.

### Example Output Details - 

- NooBaa endpoint response:
  - Curl command to NooBaa endpoint returned successfully, therefore, NooBaa health reports RUNNING.

- invalid_accounts: 
  - The new_buckets_path of account_invalid's doesn't exist in the file system, therefore, NooBaa health reports STORAGE_NOT_EXIST.
  - The uid/gid/user of account_inaccessible has insufficient read and write permissions to its new_buckets_path, therefore, NooBaa health reports ACCESS_DENIED.

- invalid_buckets:
  - The config file of bucket1 is invalid. Therefore, NooBaa health reports INVALID_CONFIG.
  - The underlying file system directory of bucket3 is missing. Therefore, NooBaa health reports STORAGE_NOT_EXIST.

- config_directory: 
  - the config directory phase is unlocked, config directory version is "1.0.0", matching source code/package version is "5.18.0" and there is no ongoing upgrade.


## Health Errors
