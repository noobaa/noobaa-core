# Ceph S3 Tests - Pending List Status

## Introduction
Ceph S3 tests are unofficial AWS S3 compatibility tests written in Python (for more information see: [ceph/s3-test](https://github.com/ceph/s3-tests) repository on GitHub) that we use in our CI.

## Pending List Status
Attached a table with tests that where investigated and their status (this table is partial).
