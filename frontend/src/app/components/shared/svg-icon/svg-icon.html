Forcing recreation of the <use> element each time the href value changes (using ko.with)
This is done due to the fact that chrome 58 broke behavior that cause changes to xlink:href
to be ignored which manifested itself as empty icons (issue #2994)
-->
<svg ko.style.fill="fill" ko.style.stroke="stroke" ko.with="href">
    <use xlink:href ko.attr="{ 'xlink:href': $data }"></use>
