Christine: We have been trying to bust Luthor Fisk for years, and it's not just about he drugs that he's moved, but it's about the bodies he's piled up along the way. I want this guy stopped and in a cell.

Dylan: Yeah, we all do. That's why I signed up for this.

Christine: I just want you to understand what you've signed up for.  Less prep time means a great possibility of slip-ups. I can't have any slip-ups.

Dylan: Okay, I got it.

Christine: Okay, so you're Derek Young, right? You need to know every name, every date, every word of this guy's background. You need to know Derek Young's identity as well as your own, if not better. If you talk in your sleep, these are the words you'd say.

Dylan: Okay, then that's how it's gonna be.

Christine: [Sighs]
